## What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm where code is organized using objects ‚Äî bundles of related data and behavior. It helps make code reusable, modular, and easy to maintain.

## 1. Class and Object

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

car1 = Car("Toyota")
print(car1.brand)
